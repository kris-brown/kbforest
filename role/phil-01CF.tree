\title{Logical entailment has topological closure structure}

\p{Logical entailment has been taken to have a [topological closure structure](math-0006)
  since [Gentzen](ref-00B2) and [Tarski](ref-00B1).}

\p{Examples}

\ul{
  \li{[Classical logic](phil-0020)}
  \li{[Intuitionistic logic](phil-0057)}
  \li{Modal logics built atop these: S4 and S5}
  \li{Traditional multivalued logics: K3 and its dual LP}
