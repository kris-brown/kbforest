\title{Irrational belief update}
\p{Given a lexicon #{\mathcal{B}}, the space of possible commitments is #{\mathcal{P(B)}}.}

\p{Absent any constraints of requiring \em{reasons} for update, all conceivable transitions are allowed. This is an indiscrete category.}

\p{One aspiration for a theory of reasons is to allow us to endorse subcategories of this space, where the morphisms are \em{rational} updates.}
