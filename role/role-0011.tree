\title{Category of commutative monoids with a distinguished subset}

\p{A [modalized state space](role-000M) (insofar as it is a join semilattice) is equivalent to a commutative monoid with a distinguished subset.}

\p{This could be modeled as the category of models of a finite limit sketch, which is a locally presentable category, which gives us:}

\ul{
  \li{It has all limits}
  \li{It is well-powered and well-copowered.}
  \li{It is the [reflective subcategory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+subcategory) of a presheaf category.}
