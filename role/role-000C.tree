\title{Universal property of being LX}
\import{macros}

\p{Problem: supposing that we have a (suitably-defined) category of reason relations, could we tell which ones were universal logical elaborations of others? This would be characterizing what it means to be universally \em{LX}, relationally.}

\p{There is an [endofunctor](math-002F)  #{L: \mathsf{Set}\rightarrow \mathsf{Set}} that sends each lexicon to a set of logically-elaborated expressions on that base lexicon. Because we can take an expression tree of expression trees and turn it into a single expression tree, this operation actually defines a [monad on](role-000D) #{\mathsf{Set}}.}

\p{(The Kleisli category and [Eilenberg Moore](math-002C) category for this monad are interesting.)}

\p{Here's an attempt at a category of reason relations:}

\subtree{\taxon{definition}
\p{Let #{RRel} be a category of reason relations with objects #{(B:Set, I\subseteq \mathcal{P}(B)^2)}}
\p{Let #{Hom_{RRel}((A,I_A),(B,I_B))} be the set of functions #{A\rightarrow B} such that #{\forall (\Gamma, \Delta) \in I_A: (f(\Gamma),f(\Delta))\in I_B}}
}

\p{We can also apply the monad #{L} to a monad on #{RRel}, as the meanings of the connectives state how to lift the relation on the base vocabulary, #{\vsim} to a relation on the logical lexicon.}

\p{Now, what is the universal property of the unit #{\eta_L}, which sends a vocabulary to its logical elaboration? Can we express formally for it to be LX? One way to express "elaborated from" is to say that #{\eta_L} is a monic function which furthermore satisfies the property that #{\forall (\Gamma, \Delta) \notin I_A: (f(\Gamma),f(\Delta))\notin I_B}.}

\p{The "expressive of" feature says that every element of the lexicon of #{\eta_L(B)} is expressive of an element of #{\mathcal{P}(B)^2}. I've yet to work out what this could mean in terms of universal properties. However, another way to think of this is that if the reason relation #{(B,I)} \em{had} been different, the reason relation #{\eta_L(B)} \em{would be} different. So perhaps we cannot characterize #{\eta_L(B)} purely in the category above but rather need to be working in a double category that also involves normative relations between reason relations.}


\subtree{\title{A strategy}

\p{If the notion of morphism #{(B,I) \rightarrow (B',J)} is a pair of interpretation functions #{\brack{\cdot}^+,\brack{\cdot}^-}, such that, for all #{\Gamma,\Delta \subseteq \mathcal{P}(B)}:}

\p{Note these aren't truly epi and mono, but perhaps there is a [weak factorization system](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/weak+factorization+system) where interpretation maps that send sentences to single sentences are #{L} maps and maps that hit upon all roles in the reason relation are #{R} maps.}
\p{A possible double categorical representation: if we look at interpretation functions as horizontal morphisms and monic functions as vertical morphisms}
