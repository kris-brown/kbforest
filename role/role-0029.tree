\title{A category of claimables and RSRs}

\subtree{\title{Failure}

\p{This is not going well. Firstly, if we consider hom sets are RSRs (each arrow is an implication which can get you from the premises to the conclusions) then we cannot compose the arrows (because #{f} maybe in #{RSR(\Gamma,\Delta)\cap RSR(\Delta,\Theta)} but not #{RSR(\Gamma, \Theta)}). This problem is not solved by enriching in the category of pointed sets (so that we could have a #{\bot} value to send arrows which fail to compose): this is because composition would fail to be associative.}

\p{We can also think of the morphisms being \em{roles} for which #{\Gamma \vsim \Delta} is in the role's RSR. This allows us to compose morphisms #{\Gamma\rightarrow \Delta\rightarrow \Theta} (by symjunction or adjunction) and then adjunction with #{RSR(\Gamma,\Theta)} in order to enforce the resulting role is a valid one for #{\Gamma\rightarrow\Theta}. Here composition is well-defined, but it fails to be associative.}

\subtree{\title{Coalgebra}

\p{A coalgebra for the power set functor defines a category of reason relations}

\p{Objects are a choice of set #{B} (of bearers) and a function #{B \rightarrow \cP(B)}, which is a relation on #{B}.}
}

\import{macros}

\p{Objects: claimables (#{\cP(B)}) for some set #{B}. \ul{\li{Alternatively, we can think of a monoidal product with generators from #{B} (this opens the door to toggling contraction, symmetry, etc.)}

\li{Though in that case, one has to show that #{\otimes: \cat{C}\times \cat{C}\rightarrow \cat{C}} is a functor, and associators+unitors}}}

\p{Note that the reason relation #{\II} induces is an endofunction #{RSR: \cP(\cP(B)^2) \rightarrow \cP(\cP(B)^2).}}

\p{Morphisms #{\Gamma \rightarrow \Delta}: [implicational roles](phil-01CQ) that are truth conditions for #{\Gamma \vsim \Delta}
\ul{
\li{Given the [RSR](role-0005) function induced by } implicational roles (literally subsets of #{\cP(B)^2}) are generated by all sets of subsets #{X \subseteq \cP(B)^2} quotiented by  subject to #{{\Gamma \vsim \Delta \in RSR(X)}}}
\li{The formula for RSR for a set of implications is the intersection of the elements' RSRs, so this means #{{\forall (\Lambda,\Theta) \in f, \Gamma \vsim \Delta \in RSR(\Lambda \vsim \Theta)}}}
\li{This means that #{\Hom(\Gamma,\Delta) := \cP(RSR(\Gamma\vsim \Delta))/\sim}. Any combination of implications that validate #{\Gamma \vsim \Delta} presents a morphism.}
}


\p{There is a set of implications which are good \em{no matter what} (at least #{\Gamma \vsim \Gamma}, but also #{a,b\vsim a} if we assume containment). Call this set #{C} for containment. Any subset of #{C} has the same role, which we call #{\top = \cP(B)^2}. }

\p{The identity #{\Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma} is #{\{\top\}}: the set of all truth conditions (because #{\Gamma\vsim^\uparrow \Gamma})
\ul{
\li{\strong{Problem}: when #{\Gamma=\varnothing}, this is not true. #{\Hom(\varnothing,\varnothing)=\cP(\II)}}}}
\p{Composition of morphisms #{f:\Gamma \rightarrow \Delta} and #{{g: \Delta \rightarrow \Omega}} is given by intersection #{{f \cap g \cap RSR(\Gamma\vsim\Omega)}} . \ul{
\li{The last intersection with #{RSR(\Gamma\vsim\Omega)} enforces that composition is closed (without that, there might be #{a\vsim b} in both #{f} and #{g}, yet #{\Gamma,a\not\vsim b,\Omega} ... which means that #{a\vsim b} does not appear in the set of any morphism in #{\Hom(\Gamma, \Omega)}).}
\li{This is clearly associative and unital with respect to #{\top}.}}
}

\p{Let's look at some structure in this category. Firstly, an initial object would be a claimable #{\bot} such that #{\forall \Gamma, RSR(\bot \vsim \Gamma)=\varnothing}. However, because of containment, if there are any bearers in #{\bot} then there will automatically be a #{\top} #{RSR} with any claimable that has #{\bot} in the conclusory role. And the empty claimable will only have this property is \em{no} implications hold save for the containment ones. The same argument applies to terminal objects.}

\p{Now lets consider products:}

    \arrow["\top", from=2-2, to=3-3]
  \end{tikzcd}}

\p{Suppose there exists a claimable #{\Gamma \land \Delta} which has an premisory role of #{\Gamma \cup \Delta} and a conclusory role of #{RSR(\vsim \Gamma) \cap RSR(\vsim \Delta) \cap RSR(\vsim \Gamma,\Delta)}. Let #{! = f \cup g}. This clearly would make the triangles commute, and is the minimal set guaranteed to be big enough to make them commute. But for it to exist, we need:}

##{\Omega, \Theta \vsim \Lambda, (\Gamma \land \Delta) \text{  and  } \Omega, \Xi, \vsim \Sigma, (\Gamma \land \Delta) \text{  ...  }}

\p{This also obtains given the conclusory role of #{\Gamma \land \Delta}. All that remains for this to be a product is that the morphism is unique. But given the conclusory role, no irrelevant implications can be added to #{!} while still being in #{RSR(\Omega, \Gamma \land \Delta)}.}

\p{There seems to be a double-category structure, given that there is a lattice on the morphisms and the objects:}

}

\p{
  However, because of lack of monotonicity, there's nothing privileged about adding bearers (via vertical arrows) vs removing them, save for the fact that the additions form a lattice. Perhaps the vertical maps could be changes of any sort.
