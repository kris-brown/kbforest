\title{About hyperdoctrines}
\p{Rather than just a 'theory category', we have a functor #{\tau \rightarrow \mathbb{C}} from a 'category of types' into some category whose internal logic we wish to work in.}
\p{Let's assume #{\mathbb{C}} is a category of Boolean algebras to recover classical logic (though could swap for, e.g., Heyting algebras to obtain intuitionistic logic).}
\p{This generalizes functorial semantics by allowing us to associate to each object #{A} an arbitrary poset, instead of assuming we just want the poset of subobjects of #{A}.}
\p{I give an example of this approach [here](https://forest.localcharts.org/ksb-0001.xml).}
\p{Propositional logic corresponds to a category of types that is discrete (one for each atomic proposition). This gives us hope for a path forward that there are certain sets in the R4L formalism that can be redescribed as discrete categories, but when viewed as a general categories will allow for quantification.}
