\title{Logic is useless for talking about material concepts}

\p{"#{X} is to the east of #{Y} entails #{Y} is to the west of #{X}" \em{is} a good inference due to the conceptual content of 'east' and 'west'. However, under traditional logical analysis, nontrivial inferences between non-logical vocabulary are forced to be treated as having supressed premises, meaning logic is useless for talking about material concepts.}
