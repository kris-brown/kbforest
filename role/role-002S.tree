\title{Direct definition of implicational role adjunction}
\taxon{definition}
\import{macros}

\p{Given the ability to [recover a canonical presentation of an implicational role](role-002T), the \em{direct} definition of adjunction becomes:}

##{  \cR \sqcup \cR' := RSR(\{a+b\ |\ a \in RSR(\cR), b \in RSR(\cR')\})
}

\p{Perhaps there is a way to massage this into something that is actually direct / more elegant, rather than just converting to a (canonical) representative and using the [old definition](phil-01CR). But this does match up precisely with #{A â…‹ B := (A^*\otimes B^*)^*} in the phase-space semantics.}

\p{Other recastings of the formula look like}

\ul{
\li{#{\{s \in S\ |\ (a,b) \in S^2, a \in RSR(\cR) \land b \in RSR(\cR') \land a+b+s \in \II \}}}
\li{#{\{s \in S\ |\ (a,b) \in S^2, a\in RSR(\cR \cup \{b,s\})  \land b \in RSR(\cR'\cup \{a,s\})\}}}
}
