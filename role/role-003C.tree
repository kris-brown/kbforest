\title{Functor from Role to ImpFrame}
\import{macros}

\p{Without actually picking a specific #{\cat{ImpFrame}}, it will be hard to define a functor \em{into} it.}

\p{Also, we'd need to be precise about which category #{\cat{Role}} is the codomain of our previous functor (Thin star-autonomous catgories? Atomistic join semilattices?)}

\p{Nevertheless, it \em{is} natural to think that there is a corresponding implication frame for a given a atomistic lattice of roles.}

\p{There is a [fruitful](role-003E) notion of \em{role inclusion} which can play the role of #{\II}, as it something that is true or false for pairs of sets of roles:}

\transclude{role-003H}

\p{Because the information of #{\cat{Role}} is captured in its atoms, I suspect the corresponding implication frame for such an object should have, as its set #{\cL_\cX} of claimables, the set of \em{atoms}.}

\p{This would be a transitive implication frame, but not necessarily monotonic. However, assuming containment, transitivity is enough to obtain [weak monotonicity](math-006S).}

\p{Defining these two functors such that they form an [adjoint pair](math-0028) would yield a monad whose [Kleisli category](math-002G) would send claimables of one implication frame to roles of another.}
