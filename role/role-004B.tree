\p{Once again we'll use colimits in \strong{Set} to define this, but a decision remains to be made about what #{\II} should be. If we made #{\II} empty for the quotient, it would trivially satisfy the continuity constraint (but would then be unable to map into anything else, so we would never obtain a universal map out of the quotient). If we made it total, the coequalizing map from #{B} would not, in general, satisfy the continuity constraint. The universal choice is to make the quotient #{\II} as true as we possibly can, which means we need to know what in #{B} is true in virtue of having two maps #{f,g} from #{A}. This leads to our definition:}

\p{The [coequalizer](math-005M) of #{\cat{IF_c}} [continuous implication frame](role-0045) maps #{f,g: A \rightrightarrows B}, written as #{Coeq(f,g)} or just #{Q}, has #{\cL_{Q}:=(\cL_A+\cL_B)/\sim} and a coequalizing arrow #{q: B \twoheadrightarrow Q} given by the coequalizer in \strong{Set}. #{\II_Q} is determined by #{{\II_{A}}}:}

\p{Note that #{f;q=g;q}, so it doesn't matter which we pick.}

\subtree{\taxon{proof}

\p{Given #{{h}}, the universal property in \strong{Set} gives us the unique morphism #{{u:Q \xrightarrow{u} X}}. That this is unique (if it exists) is given by the fact we are looking at a [subcategory](math-003Z) of [\strong{Set}](math-003L), so we just need to verify that #{u} satisfies the continuity constraint.}

\p{From the assumption that #{i \in \II_{X}}, we need to show that #{u^{-1}(i) \in \II_{Q}}. From how #{\II_Q} is defined, this means showing that #{(f;q)^{-1}(u^{-1}(i)) \in \II_A}. From functorality of the [contravariant power set functor](math-006J), we know #{u^{-1};(f;q)^{-1} = (f;q;u)^{-1} = (f;h)^{-1}}. That #{{f;h}^{-1}(i)\in \II_A} follows from the existence of the composite map #{f;h}, which must obey the continuity constraint.
