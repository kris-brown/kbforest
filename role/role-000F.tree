\title{Double category of interpretation functions}
\import{macros}

\p{Define a [double category](math-000S)}
\ul{
\li{Objects are implication frames (agnostic as to whether 'generated' from a pragmatic-normative or alethic-modal reason relation): #{(\mathcal{B}, \mathbb{I}\subseteq \mathcal{P(B)^2})}}
\li{Vertical morphisms are overlaps of bearers, with no constraint on how the reason relations are related: #{f: \mathcal{B} \leftarrowtail \bullet \rightarrowtail \mathcal{B'} }}
\li{Horizontal morphisms #{\brack{\cdot}: S \pro T} are pairs of interpretation functions with no constraint from the reason relations.}
\li{Squares are rational updates: changes which rectify \em{some} obligation by the top interpretation.}

\p{(Sidenote: Having vertical maps as partial injectives allows us, thinking in pragmatic normative terms, to drop certain expressions from the lexicon and introduce new ones. We could consider using a relation or a span two relate the two sets, introducing the ability to merge expressions together or split them apart.)}

\p{For any pair of reason relations there are a vast number of interpretation functions. Most of these are meaningless, but we can take a stance by privileging a certain subcategory as the normatively-binding ones.}

\p{We can take these morphisms to be a \em{putative} representational relations, e.g. to accept the interpretation #{R \rightarrow A} is to say that #{R} is responsible to #{A} (or #{A} is authorative over #{R}).}

\p{We can imagine a chain like #{LayPerson \rightarrow Science \rightarrow RealWorld \rightarrow Science} }

\p{This could be the appropriate setting to understand \em{order of explanation}.}

\p{The fact we have loops (e.g. between our PN vocabulary and our TM vocabulary) can be a justification of \em{mutual sense dependence}.}

\p{The hope is that something like this is an appropriate neutral setting in which we can talk about many different perspectives:}

\ul{
  \li{The Carnappian two-stage model of language is that we can start with a language (with an empty reason relation), put it in contact with the world, and then derive how we ought talk about the world.

\p{ We can describe such a process, but this framework also lets us see that we need not start from 'nothing' - there's no universal property that distinguishes this from starting from any other set of commitments. Furthermore, because rational hysteresis is nondeterministic, we need preexisting commitments if we want to claim not all paths are equivalently good.}
