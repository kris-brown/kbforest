\title{Consensus and cooperation}
\p{The healthy society we aim for has some level of trust and \strong{cooperation} at many levels of granularity, e.g. people (between individual biology researchers), groups (between psychology research groups), and communities (between laypeople and the scientific community; between different political parties). One way of achieving trust and cooperation is through \strong{consensus}, but consensus is a much stronger requirement than cooperation. In a complex and global society, maintaining consensus is infeasible or undesirable (e.g. requiring consensus in religious matters is at odds with [liberal democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy) values). }

\p{Mathematicians and scientists realize that truth is more important than consensus - we all could be in agreement \em{yet} wrong about something. If society instead pursued truth, the above concerns about consensus and cooperation seem addressed.[^cc] When two competing visions collide, the true one ought win out. Math and science are taken to be paradigmatic truth-seeking activities, so certain scientific models are taken as \strong{foundational} or final (an authority that isn't responsible to the authority of anything else). When such an attitude is adopted, often unconsciously,[^owen] one is unable to update one's model of the world. Things aren't much better if one's model of the world is "responsive to the facts" yet one's model \em{space} is uncritically held fixed. By taking some model (possibly a model of possible models) as foundationally true, social conflict and disagreement becomes bitter and is raised to high stakes, as this conception of truth is something that demands consensus, not mere cooperation.}

\p{[^owen]: For example, certain modeling assumptions are codified in software which is not feasible to update, thereby becoming foundational truth for all practical purposes.}

\p{[^cc]: Truth is seen as a convergence point, so consensus is a consequence of collective truth seeking. Truth wins in the long run, so infeasibility is not a concern. As for the desirability of enforcing consensus, people are less willing to agree-to-disagree when there's a 'fact of the matter'.}

\p{Dual to this close-mindedness: one eventually sees that every past scientific model was shown to be wrong by a later one, and a [pessimistic meta-induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimistic_induction) leads one to doubt the possibility of foundational truth. Combined with the belief that pursuing truth is the only \em{rational} basis for societal cooperation, this promotes uncooperative behavior; this is the \em{bad} way to interpret "All models are wrong, some are useful." In summary, scientists are at risk of oscillating between foundationalism and skepticism, a pathology [Rorty](rorty) diagnoses in [Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/#EpisBeha) as stemming from this particular conception of truth.}
