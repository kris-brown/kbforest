\title{Historical examples}

\p{As described [[01 - The Concept of Representation|in this lecture]], two strands of pre-Kantian philosophy can be illuminated by thinking of them as battles over the order of explanation:}  

\p{| | [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] | Rationalists |
|--|--|--|
| \strong{Examples} | [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]] | [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] |
| \strong{Order of explanation between two kinds of mental objects} | Understand sentence-like thoughts as complex+abstracted combinations of picture-like impressions | Understand picture-like impressions as peculiar kinds of sentence-like thoughts |
| \strong{Order of explanation between two features of concepts} | Understand how judgments follow from each other by understanding the constituent concepts and what they represent in the world | Explain representational content in terms of the more primitive reason relations concepts stand in. |

- The debate between [deontology vs consequentialism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoFoiCon) in ethics can be seen as a fight over the explanatory priority of concepts of the Right (actions) vs the Good (states of affairs).

- The early [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] sought to explain truth in terms of inference (sentences are 
primitive because they are the smallest unit which has pragmatic force), 
vice-versa for the late Frege.

- We have statements which are good in virtue of their logical form (logical 
  inferences, e.g. "#{A} and #{B}, therefore #{A}") as well as statements which are just 
  good (materially-good inferences, e.g. "If #{X} is to the #{East} of #{Y}, then #{Y} is to the 
  #{West} of #{X}.") - [Sellars](wilfrid-sellars) advocates that we understand material inference as more 
  fundamental to logical inference.

- Debates in philosophy of language can be recasted as arguing over the 
  preferred order of explanation between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 
  E.g. how do we think of the [relationships](int-0016) between declarative sentences, propositions, and speech acts?
