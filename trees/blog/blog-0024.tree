\title{Running example}
\p{I'll try to concretize certain ideas introduced here through a running example, where a business owner named Bob has been coerced by the state to pay a fine. Alice, the judge, cites \strong{Statute #123} in her ruling. The statute says "Business owners who require customers to sign unreasonable contracts are subject to a fine." }
