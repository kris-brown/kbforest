\title{Postmodern scientific modeling}

\p{What is required to have cooperation in the absence of consensus? We need to ground our reasoning in formal models yet fluidly move between different modeling frameworks, to never be trapped within a particular one. Category theory provides a toolset for this kind of thinking in a mathematical setting. For example, consider [categorical systems theory](https://topos.site/blog/2021/11/categorical-systems-theory/): there existed many disjoint, monolithic theories of what it means to be a system. Rather than add a new monolith, category theory is used to contextualize and systematize these formulations of "systems theory" in a way that elucidates their relationships to each other.}

\p{AlgebraicJulia makes this perspective tangible in various ways: disparate models can be joined together via colimits ("we talked in different ways but certain subsets of our talk were about the same thing") and via limits ("we were both looking at different aspects of the same thing").[^soph] Two modeling paradigms can be related to each other by data migration functors; by opening the scientist's eyes to the possibility of data migration, what was formally their space of possible models becomes a point in a space of model spaces. By creating the technology to enable the engineer and scientist to ergonomically shift their perspective in this way, we believe AlgebraicJulia will materially affect the engineering and scientific communities in their flexibility of thinking and capacity for coordination.}

\p{The ontological humility category theory brings to pure mathematics (e.g. the debates over what actually \em{is} a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Set-theoretic_definition) \em{vs} the [natural numbers object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers_object) of a category) can be extended to the mathematical models scientists use to ground their understanding of the world. This promotes a healthier scientific community by allowing us to make explicit the relationships between that which we take to be foundational, thereby allowing us to change foundations when appropriate and to cooperate with those of other perspectives.}
