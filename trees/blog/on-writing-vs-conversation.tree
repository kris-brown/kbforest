\title{On writing vs conversation}

\p{

When I write, there are lots of qualifications I'd like to make, since my words 
all have connotations / implications which I may or not be aware of and may or 
may not endorse. Good writers manage to avoid endless parentheticals,
qualifiers, and footnotes.

One explanation for in-person discussion being much more productive and having 
fewer miscommunications is that each unintended connotation can be immediately 
detected and addressed. In a static text document, one has to anticipate 
exactly which connotations each reader will bring to their reading.

I hope for a technological solution to more nuanced communication that 
does not require in-person interaction. Something with good ergonomics for 
sharing a writing piece that is heavily interlinked with one's "digital garden"
/ "personal wiki" would allow readers to 
pursue threads as far as their curiosity permits without cluttering the main 
thrust of the writing.
