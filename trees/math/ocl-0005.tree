\p{The way data migration actually works in practice is that it is a two-step process. The first step is to allow more things to be defined. For instance, add an optional column to a table. The second step is to \em{require} that those things are actually defined, i.e. make the optional column non-optional. These mathematically look like a cospan; the old schema and the new schema both embed into the intermediate schema.}
