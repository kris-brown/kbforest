\title{Finitely-presented category}

\p{A \em{finitely-presented category} is a [graph](math-0059) equipped with some equations between parallel paths. We interpret the vertices as objects and edges as \em{generating} morphisms of some category. The morphisms of this category are all paths in the graph, quotiented by the equations.}
