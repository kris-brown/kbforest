\title{Explicit and implicit content of [turnstile](phil-01BU)}
\import{macros}

\p{The expression #{\Gamma \vsim B} (snake-turnstile) says: given some \em{explicit} content #{\Gamma}, that #{B} is part of its \em{implicit} content.}

\p{Etymologically, this is motivated by \em{content} of set being what is \em{contained} in it.}
