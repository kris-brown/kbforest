\p{The first bullet point in above definition says the [evaluation functor](math-00BN) is [essentially surjective](math-002M).}

\p{The second bullet point says it is [full](math-002I) and [faithful](math-002K)}

\p{This determines the [syntactic category](math-00BB), up to [equivalence](math-002B), by this [universal mapping property](math-00BU).}
