\title{Translation of algebraic theories}

\source{ref-00BC}

\p{\em{Syntactically} a translation between two [algebraic theories](math-009Q) involves assigning types and terms of one theory to types and terms of the other, while respecting axioms.}

\p{We can abstractly characterize such a translation by a [functor](math-000E) between the their corresponding categories.}
