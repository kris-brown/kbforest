  \p{A [model](math-00AH) of the [trivial algebraic theory](math-00A4) \T in some category \C is just a choice of some object in \C, as there are no operations and therefore no other data to provide.}

  \p{A morphism of models is just a morphism in \C, as there are commutativity constraints as there are no operations.}
