\title{Category of join-semilattices}

\subtree{\taxon{definition}
\p{The [category](math-000D) of [join-semilattices](math-006Z) has join-semilattices as objects and [monotone-maps](math-0068) which preserve #{\vee} and #{\bot} as morphisms. Because join-semilattices have all joins, they must have all meets, and so are lattices. But morphisms of this category are only required to preserve the joins.}
}

\p{This is a category of varieties. It is the category of algebras of a Lawvere theory.}
