\title{Incremental homomorphism search: deletion}

\p{Depending on one's implementation of #{\cat{C}}[-Sets](math-00E1), addressing deletion of data ranges from trivial to very easy. }

\p{If one's underlying elements can be marked as deleted, then we need not do anything at that moment in time to the existing answer set. Rather, at the time of \em{using} any morphism #{f:X\rightarrow G} in our answer set, it can be checked for validity by seeing if the image of #{f} touches upon any elements which have been marked as deleted.}

\p{If one's representation of the underlying sets of a #{\cat{C}}-set are simply integers (representing the set #{\{1,...,n\}}), then a deletion #{d: G_1\leftarrowtail G_2} involves nontrivial data. Given a map #{X\rightarrow G_1} which does not have any deleted data in its image, one can obtain a map #{X\rightarrow G_2} via [pullback](math-000J):}

\p{In this case, whenever one applies a deletion one should iterate through one's matches, apply the above pullback to replace each #{f_1} with a #{f_2}, discarding the original match #{f_1} from the answer set if the top morphism is not an isomorphism.}
