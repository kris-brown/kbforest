\title{Topological space}
\taxon{definition}

\p{A \em{topological space} is a set #{X} equipped with set of subsets #{U \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)} called \em{open sets} such that}

\ul{
  \li{Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of open sets is an open set}
  \li{Any finite intersection of open sets is an open set}}

\p{Note: because #{\varnothing} and #{X} are the intersection and union (respectively) of zero open sets, these are both automatically open sets.}
