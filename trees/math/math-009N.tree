\title{Function as a special kind of relation (graph)}
\taxon{definition}
\p{A [relation](math-0002) between [sets](math-0001) #{A} and #{B} is a \em{function} #{A \xrightarrow{f} B} if it has exactly one element #{(a_i,b_j)} for each #{a_i \in A}.}

\p{This relation can be thought of as the function itself or is called the \em{graph} of the function.}
