\title{On Brandom's analysis of reference}
\author{huw-price}
\blockquote{
What Brandom actually does is not to “construe referential relations” (as having such and such a nature, for example), or to “make sense of reference” (itself ), but rather to offer us an account of the use of referential \em{vocabulary}: he tells us about the use of the \em{term} “refers”, not about the reference \em{relation} – about \em{ascriptions} of reference, not about reference itself.
