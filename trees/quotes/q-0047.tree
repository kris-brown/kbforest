\title{Functional pluralism}

The second hopeful sign for Deweyan optimists, in my view, is the persistence, within the borders of representationalism, of a series of breakaway movements—each contending that the representationalist framework claims no proper dominion over some \em{local} region of its apparent territory, and offering an alternative, 'expressivist', account of the region in question. While most of these breakaway movements are (perhaps hopelessly) local in their ambitions, I think that the threat they pose collectively is substantial (and underrated). I'll call it the threat of \em{functional pluralism}: a challenge to the homogeneity of the representationalist empire. Interpreted in this optimistic light, these breakaway views do locally what Wittgenstein did globally. They challenge the assumption that language has a single core function, viz., to 'represent how things are'.
