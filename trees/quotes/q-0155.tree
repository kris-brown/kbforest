\title{Truth not interesting}
\author{Richard Rorty}

\p{

> The essays in this book are attempts to draw consequences from a pragmatist theory about truth. This theory says that truth is not the sort of thing one should expect to have a philosophically interesting theory about. For pragmatists, "truth" is just the name of a property which all true statements share. Pragmatists doubt that there is much to be said about this common feature.
