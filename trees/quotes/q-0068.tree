\title{Lewis picks Peirce over James}

In the great debate between Peirce and James, he sides with Peirce (whose papers he “lived with” for two years upon arrival at Harvard as a faculty member): “When we determine truth, we determine that which it is correct to believe and that upon which it is desirable (not merely desired) to act”. [Lewis](ci-lewis) is dead set against the abandonment of evidence and reasons to the vagaries of wants and needs.
