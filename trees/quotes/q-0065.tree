\title{Labels vs describing}

\p{

[[Wilfrid Sellars|Author]]

> It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe 
objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it 
all rather than merely label. 

—  [[Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities]] §108

- Describing is what science is the measure of all things about.
- Sellars says "concepts as classifiers" is [[Concepts and judgment|not enough]] to get to descriptions.
