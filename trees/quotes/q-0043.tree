> To make firsthand use of modal expressions / subjunctive conditionals, is to
be about the business of explaining a state of affairs or justifying an
assertion. 

—  [[Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities]] §80


Keep in mind the "argument types" of explanation and justification.
- We *explain* an (actual) state of affairs. 
- We *justify* an assertion (non-actual, in the space of reasons).
