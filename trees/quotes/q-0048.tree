Kant and Hegel went only halfway in their repudiation of the idea that truth is "out there". They were willing to view the world of empirical science as a made world - to see matter as constructed for mind ... but they persisted in seeing mind, spirit, the depths of the human self, as having an intrinsic nature - one which could be known by a kind of nonempirical super science called philosophy. This meant that only one half of truth - the bottom, scientific half - was made. Higher truth, the truth about the mind, the province of philosophy, was still a matter of discovery rather than creation.
