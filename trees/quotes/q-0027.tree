\title{Criticizing truth as correspondence}
\author{rorty}

\blockquote{The earnest reductionism of Bain and Mill and the equally earnest romanticism of Royce drove aesthetical ironists like James and Bradley, as well as social reformers like the young Dewey, to proclaim the unreality of traditional epistemological problems and solutions. They were provoked to radical criticisms of "truth as correspondence" and "knowledge as accuracy of representations", thus threatending the entire Kantian notion of philosophy as metacriticism of the special disciplines.
