\title{Rorty's legacy}

\blockquote{
In the end, Rorty's adamant skepticism and anti-dogmatism are simply ways to be anti- authoritarian and irreverently anti-fetishistic. There is no supreme power that can offer an alibi, warrant, or proof for our claims and beliefs, nothing except fallible human authority. There is no supreme authority, other than the authority of human justifications and reasons, whose only power is the power of persuasion.
