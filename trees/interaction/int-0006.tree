\title{Looks-talk and Is-talk}

\p{
  We are used to explaining statements like "The frog is on the log" from statements like "It looks like the frog is on the log" or "It seems like there is a green blob on a brown blob." This is because, since Descartes, that statements about perceptions are taken as undoubtable, whereas statements about the world could be mistaken. There is a standard, hand-wavy story of how our rich understanding of the world could come about from these perceptions (or the denial that the world is as rich as we think it is).}

\p{This order of explanation is reversed by [Sellars](sellars) in [Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind](ref-0016): we understand "it looks like the frog is on the log" in terms of the is-talk. We can understand it as stating a confession to \em{want to} make an assertion while deliberately withholding that assertion.
}
\p{In both cases, the key phenomenon to explain is why looks-talk has the special status of being unquestionable whereas is-talk can be questioned. In the Cartesian case, a perceiving of a perceiving is still a perceiving. In the Sellarsian case, withholding of a commitment from a statement whose commitment has already been withheld likewise does nothing.
