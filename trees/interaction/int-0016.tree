# Order of explanation 

- Should reason relations be explained in terms of social practices[^rr]
- Should the reason relations determine \em{proper} social practices? 

Brandom's Hegel tells a story of how \em{both} actual practice and pre-existing norms exercise authority and are each responsible to each other.

[^rr]: Rorty: "[truth](phil-0142) is what your contemporaries let you get away with saying"
