\title{Norm-fact dualism}

\p{

A [[dualisms|dualism]]. 

A problem for those who try to address the problem of [[Mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] by 
appealing to the \em{normative} character of intentionality.

- Epistemological questions: 
   - How can we know about norm stuff? in the way we know about mass? 
   - Does it causally affect us? 
- Ontological questions: 
   - Where in the world of natural science do we find these things?
