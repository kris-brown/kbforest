\title{Informational semantics}
\taxon{quote}


\blockquote{Roughly, advocates of informational semantics maintain that semantic concepts are to be explained in terms of certain lawlike correlations linking external things or property instantiations to tokenings of corresponding linguistic items or to mental items. The primary mode of semantic explanation thus proceeds by establishing 'direct' language-world mappings. Once the reference and designation relations are established by way of the said reliable correlations between linguistic or mental items and their external causal antecedents, the usual semantic concepts (reference, [truth](phil-0142), satisfaction, etc.) are simply explained from the 'bottom up': first, names are associated with their bearers, unary predicates with the properties designated and so on. In a second step, the theory then specifies compositional rules for determining the semantic values of more complex expressions as a function of their semantically relevant component parts. This atomistic mode of explanation is more congenial to certain types of expressions than it is to others. Paradigmatic cases of linguistic expressions that particularly lend themselves to information semantic explanation are observational predicates ('square', 'red') and proper names.}
