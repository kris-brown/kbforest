\blockquote{A [quasi-realist](phil-0107) of a more conventional stripe, who does want to hold onto the [bifurcation thesis](phil-0017), is committed to a kind of two-tier view of the landscape, with respect to a whole range of notions that we associate with the business of making claims and assertions. In effect, he must think that \strong{there are both loose and strict answers to questions such as: what is it to be a belief, an assertion, a statement, a judgement, a proposition (even a fact)?} The loose answer is supposed to tell us what descriptive and quasi-descriptive uses of language have in common, the strict answer what separates the real cases from the merely quasi-cases.
