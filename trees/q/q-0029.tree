\title{Denying truthmakers}

\blockquote{The later [Wittgenstein](wittgenstein), [Heidegger](heidegger), and [Dewey](dewey), for example, would all be as dubious about the notion of "truth-makers" — nonlinguistic items which "render" statements determinately true or false — as they are about that of "[representation](phil-0117)." For representationalists, "making true" and "representing" are reciprocal relations: the nonlinguistic item which makes #{S} true is the one represented by #{S}. But antirepresentationalists see both notions as equally unfortunate and dispensable — not just in regard to statement of some disputed class, but in regard to all statements.
