\blockquote{Do not be troubled by the fact that languages [(2)](q-015G) and (8) consist only of orders. If you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask yourself whether our language is complete;â€”whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses}
