\blockquote{
  [Misak](misak)'s dialectical use of [Rorty](rorty) means that she can find nothing in his work that is both distinctive and of lasting value to [pragmatism](phil-0103). He represents, in her story, what you get if you put [James](william-james)'s psychologism and subjectivism through the [linguistic turn](phil-01DP) and call the result pragmatism.
