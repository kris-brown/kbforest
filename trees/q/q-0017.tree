[Here](q-0054) is how [Lewis](ci-lewis) suggests we think of the a priori. The anticipation of [Quine](quine), it will be noted, could not be stronger. This is from [Mind and the World Order](ref-0032), written in 1929, long before Lewis' own students — Quine and [Goodman](goodman) (and Morton White) - bizarrely started to use these very thoughts against Lewis himself. And it is very similar to [Peirce](pierce)'s view of how we should regard what we find indispensable. [A priori](phil-0003) "truths" are not necessarily [true](phil-0142). They are simply what we need to articulate our world view. They could be revised, but only at great cost to that world view.
