\title{A pragmatist-friendly distinction between matters of fact and matters of value}


\p{Suppose it's characteristic of moral arguments that rationality of opponents is not dependent on an agreement between them. That there exists such a thing as a rational disagreement is the marker.}


\p{Without the hope of agreement, argument would be pointless, but it doesn't follow that w/o reaching an agreement the argument was pointless.}

  \p{This possibility counters the argument from the existence of irresolvable disagreements in ethics to the absence of cognitive meaning in ethics.}
