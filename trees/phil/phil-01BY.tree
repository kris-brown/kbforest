\title{Deduction detachment condition}

\subtree{\taxon{definition}
\p{The conditional obeys the \em{deduction detachment condition} when:} \p{#{\Gamma \vdash A \rightarrow B, \Delta} iff #{\Gamma, A \vdash B, \Delta}}
}

\p{This property is says the conditional makes the metalinguistic implication turnstile explicit in the logically extended object language.}

\p{One could consider this a criterion of adequacy for any binary operator that is called a "conditional".}
