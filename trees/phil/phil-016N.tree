\title{Distinguishing speech acts from utterances}
\date{2024-04-03}

\p{The [speech act](phil-016M) of promising to climb the Eiffel Tower must be distinguished from utterances of "I promise to climb the Eiffel Tower".}

\p{As an example, consider someone who says the statement while sleep talking.}

\p{This is important because speech acts live in a normative space, whereas utterances admit a fully naturalistic description.}
