\title{Analogy between rule following and purpose of philosophy}
\author{kris-brown}

\p{In the [rule-following considerations](phil-017P), we see we cannot \em{always} clarify meanings with explicit rules (which always need further rules to be interpreted), but rather at some point the explanation needs to bottom out in actual practice.}

\p{This balance between explicit rules and actual practice reminds me of another tension, between "[theory](phil-018V) formulation" and "therapy"/"[quietism](phil-018U)" when talking about the purpose of philosophy: at some point in the theorizing process, the philosophical explanation needs to bottom out in quietism.}

\p{Agreeing with these ideas isn't to dismiss the value of explicit rules or philosophical theorizing: where to draw that "bottoming out" line is a spectrum that people fall onto.}
