\title{Arthritis}

\p{An example of [Burge](burge) in [Individualism and the Mental](ref-00B4).}

\p{Art is a mostly competent user of the word 'arthritis', but his understanding of the word is \em{partial}.} 

\p{Art says, 'I have arthritis in my thigh.' This is impossible, as arthritis is definitionally an inflammation of the joints. If we tell Art this, he'll admit that what he said cannot be the case.}

\p{The philosophical questions concern what Art actually believed - what were his conceptual contents. Did he believe a contradiction?}
