\title{Montaigne's dog}

\p{

  Montaigne is impressed that his dog, when chasing a rabbit and coming to a fork, runs a little way down one of the paths and smells no rabbit, then immediately runs down the other fork of the path without stopping to smell to check if the rabbit went that way.[^cite] }

\p{The dog is acting in accordance with the disjunctive [syllogism](phil-0196). Do we say that the dog understands disjunction?
