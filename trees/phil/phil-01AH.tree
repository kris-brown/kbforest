\title{Cautionary use of true}
\author{rorty}

\p{We use '[true](phil-0142)' in the sense of "I believe / am justified in what I just said, but we should remember that it might not be true" to contrast our current standards with the possible standards of those we recognize as better versions of ourselves (paradigmatically, future generations).}

\p{Recognizing a culture as a better version of our own is to "recognize them as people who have come to hold different beliefs from ours by a process which we (by our present notions of the difference between rational persuasion and force) count as rational persuasion."}
