\title{Utterance}

\p{Utterance is the act of making certain noises. This act could be one-and-the-same as \em{saying} something, but that would be looking at the same act through a different lens. These two notions can come apart, such as a parrot, AI chatbot, or sleeptalker making noises that are similar to one saying something, yet carry none of the normative / pragmatic consequeces of saying it. (Those who consider those normative aspects essential to saying anything at all then need to draw this distinction between uttering and saying).}
