\p{My teacher [Gil Harmon](gilbert-harman) said you should never really read anything that was written more than five years ago because, if it was important, people would have written about it. My classmates thought at the time that Gil was the \em{non plus ultra} of an ahistorical philosopher, but came to realize they were wrong. He was steeped in the history of philosophy - everything he did came out of his understanding of it ... it's just that he thought it started with [Quine](quine).
