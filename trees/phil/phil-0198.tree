\title{Substituting assertibility for truth}
\author{brandom}

\p{[Dewey](dewey), [Sellars](sellars), [Dummett](dummett), [Kripkenstein](kripkenstein) and others want to use assertibility as \em{the} key normative concept in their pragmatic normative vocabularies because they wanted to do some of the work otherwise done by appeal to notions of truth.}

\p{For instance, one could use assertibility conditions rather than truth conditions.}
