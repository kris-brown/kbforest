\blockquote{A particular model of correctness and incorrectness (roughly [Kant](kant)'s), in which what makes a performance correct or not is its relation to some explicit rule ... On this account, acts are liable to normative assessments insofar as they are governed by propositionally explicit prescriptions, prohibitions, and permissions.}
