\p{This is an unsatisfying solution to problems of [meaning](phil-0124) and [rule following considerations](phil-017P) due to an [infinite regress](phil-0114), as exemplified in [Achilles and the Tortoise](ref-0072).}

\p{Any explicit rule requires norms of application. Only against the background of [norms implicit in practice](phil-0189) can you make sense of norms that are [explicit in rules](phil-018A) that determine what's correct by saying what's correct.}
