\title{Declarative sentences via functional classification}

\p{One requires a set of [declarative sentences](phil-0024) in [Brandom](brandom)'s [definition of a vocabulary](phil-01B5), as the set which reason relations are defined on. But thought another way: what \em{makes} a set a set of declarative sentences is that it is a set for which there are reason relations defined on it.}
