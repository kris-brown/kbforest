\title{Biological exceptionalism}
\date{2024-04-03}

\p{Also called \em{vitalism}. An example of [exceptionalism](phil-0162) going wrong: it took the distinction between biological, living organisms vs merely-chemical things to be so deep that one could not understand the former in a purely scientific idiom (e.g. one required a [teleological](phil-016A) form of explanation). This is at odds with the success of 20th century molecular biology.}

\p{This position was popular in 19th century Germany and is downstream of [romanticism](romanticism).}
