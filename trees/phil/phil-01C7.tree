\title{Kantian problematic and [metalinguistic rationalism](phil-015Y)}

\p{Accepting the [Kantian problematic](int-0009) is tempting because it seems obvious certain features of our practice are due to us, e.g. that our statements are in English. But these motivating examples are all about the [lexicon](phil-01B6), not the [reason relations](phil-01AY), which do not require us to make this decision.}
