\p{There is no such thing as deductive inference.}

\p{If there were, \em{modus ponens} would be an example. So suppose you have premises #{p} and #{p \implies q}, you ought infer #{q}.}

\p{But your reasons against #{q} might be much stronger than your reasons for either premise.}

\p{The conditional codifies a \em{relation} which constrains but does not determine inference. Logic does not tell you what to \em{do}.}
