\p{Newton made claims about \em{mass}. Our updated understanding from Einstein involves two quantities (relativistic mass and proper mass) - neither of which satisfies the properties of Newtonian mass.}

\p{We can ask: "What was Newton referring to by 'mass'?" This is a problem of the [normativity](phil-016Y) of [reference](phil-0112) in [science](phil-0165).}
