\title{Rugby: William Webb Ellis}

\blockquote{In November of 1823 at Rugby School, an independent school in England, a boy named William Webb Ellis, gripped by a great rush of enthusiasm while playing football, began to run toward the opposing team's goal but holding the ball in his arms, ignoring the basic 'no-hands' [rule](phil-0120) of football. Ellis was said to be the first person to perform such an absurd move, but it led to the subsequent establishment of rugby football.}
