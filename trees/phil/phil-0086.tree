\title{Normative character of representation}

\p{To count as representing something is to be \em{responsible} to the represented thing.}
\p{What is represented provides the normative standard for correctness of representing.}
\p{What is represented has an \em{authority} over what is representing.}
\p{See the [Shopping list](phil-0126) example.}
\p{Brandom reads [Hegel](hegel) as reading [Kant](kant) as having pioneered this kind of normative account of representation: Kant talks about this in terms of necessity, but Hegel talks of independence (i.e. authority) and dependence (i.e. responsibility).}
\p{Applied by [Rorty](rorty) to argue for [pragmatism](phil-0103).}
\p{Also called "normative governance" by [Brandom](brandom).}
