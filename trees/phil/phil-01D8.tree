\title{Vienna Circle's attempt to formulate an empiricist criterion of meaningfulness}

\p{Quote from Hempel (1963):}

\blockquote{[The [Vienna Circle](phil-0146)'s attempts to formulate an empiricist criterion of meaningfulness] has come to play the role of the treasure hunt in the tale of the old winegrower who on his death-bed enjoins his sons to dig for a treasure hidden in the family vineyard. In untiring search, his sons turn over the soil and thus stimulate the growth of the vines: the rich harvest they reap proves to be the true and only treasure in the vineyard.}

\p{A self-fulfilling prophecy.}
