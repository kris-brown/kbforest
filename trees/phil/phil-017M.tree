\title{Brandom on naturalistic metavocabularies}
\author{brandom}
\date{2024-04-05}

\p{[Brandom](brandom) is not as anti-naturalistic as he may seem: he just requires that the naturalist be able to underwrite the \em{applicability} of normative pragmatic metavocabularies, which are required to account for the propositional contentfulness of linguistic expressions. He views Millikan's [teleosemantics](phil-0136) as the kind of naturalism he can [support](phil-017N).}
