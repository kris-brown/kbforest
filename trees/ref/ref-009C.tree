  \blockquote{In sum, we have seen that the normativity of meaning really has very little bearing on the hard problem of intentionality in any of the [four senses given above](phil-018D). The view that meaning involves rule-following or a normative judgment of some kind is untenable, and in any case, has no bearing on the hard problem of intentionality. Both the hypothesis that meaning is a source of normativity and the hypothesis that meaning is determined by normativity might in principle have a bearing on the hard problem of intentionality. However, the view that meaning is a source of normativity is implausible, and there is little evidence that known difficulties with the reductive analysis of meaning can be resolved by adding normativity to the explanation. Finally, [Gibbard](gibbard)'s recent suggestion that the concept meaning is normative is implausible and his proposed expressivist resolution of the hard problem of intentionality appears to be untenable.}
