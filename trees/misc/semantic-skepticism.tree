\title{Semantic skepticism}

\p{

A [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] insight: the *real* problematic [[skepticism]] is *semantic* skepticism.

- He doesn't take it for granted that we can 'represent' reality and merely have to worry about whether or not that representation is true.
- It might be unintelligible that our mental states even purport to specify how things are out there.
- This is a prior question to whether or not those purported claims are true.
