\title{Possible worlds semantics}

\p{

Possible worlds semantics is a semantics for [[Modal logic]].

John Etchemendy warns us to not confuse possible models in [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] model theory with possible worlds in his _The Concept of Logical Consequence_. At the root of it is where the [[Sortals]] come from (which individuate individuals in the possible worlds).
