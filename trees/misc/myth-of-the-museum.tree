\title{Myth of the Museum}

\p{


> Uncritical semantics is the myth of a museum in which the exhibits are 
meanings and the words are labels. To switch languages is to change the 
labels.

Against the museum myth, [[W.O. Quine|Quine]] argues here for the indeterminacy 
of "meaning" and translation.

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Sellars' 
[[Myth of the Given]] against sense-givenness.
