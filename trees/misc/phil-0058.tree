\title{Is-ought problem}

\p{

The is-ought problem. [Hume](david-hume). }

\p{The infeasibility of reducing "ought talk" to "is talk" is the same problem [(according to Sellars)](q-0085)
as reducing "the personal" (e.g. believing) to something at the individual rather than community (network of rights and duties) level.}

\p{Related to the naturalistic fallacy: if something is natural it must be good.
