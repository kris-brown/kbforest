\p{

# Grammar 
Grammatically, one signals reference with *of*. E.g.:
 - I'm thinking *of* a number

# As a relation
Reference has been thought of as a *relation* between linguistic terms and things in the world.

If this is true, then the linguistic term "reference" must be mapped onto the aforementioned relation.
