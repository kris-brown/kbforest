\p{

  Possible worlds semantics is a semantics for [Modal logic](phil-0076).}

\p{John Etchemendy warns us to not confuse possible models in [Tarski](tarski) model theory with possible worlds in his _The Concept of Logical Consequence_. At the root of it is where the [Sortals](phil-0130) come from (which individuate individuals in the possible worlds).
