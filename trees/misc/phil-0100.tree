\title{Possible worlds semantics}

\p{

Possible worlds semantics is a semantics for [Modal logic](phil-0076).

John Etchemendy warns us to not confuse possible models in [Tarski](alfred-tarski) model theory with possible worlds in his _The Concept of Logical Consequence_. At the root of it is where the [Sortals](phil-0130) come from (which individuate individuals in the possible worlds).
