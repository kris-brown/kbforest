\title{Is-ought problem}

\p{

The is-ought problem. [[David Hume]]. 

The infeasibility of reducing "ought talk" to "is talk" is the same problem [[On community|(according to Sellars)]]
as reducing "the personal" (e.g. believing) to something at the individual rather than community (network of rights and duties) level.

Related to the naturalistic fallacy: if something is natural it must be good.
