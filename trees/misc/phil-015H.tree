\p{Comprised of \em{talking} and \em{thinking}, conscious in the sense of [sapience](phil-015J) rather than [sentience](phil-015K). I.e. saying or thinking \em{that} things are thus-and-so (content expressed by [declarative sentences](phil-0024)), which is more than mere [practical intentionality](phil-015L).}
