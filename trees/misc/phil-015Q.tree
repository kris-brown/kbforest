\p{Should one think of [pragmatics](phil-0102) in terms of [social practices](phil-015H) or linguistic abilities? Given an [order of explanation](blog-0008) prioritizing the former, we think about the abilities that individuals need to master in order to play the role they play in the practices. The alternative order leads to thinking of the abilities as prior in the order of explanation and the practices somehow merely displaying the discursive abilities.}
