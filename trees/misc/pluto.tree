Example from [[The Centrality of Sellars' Two-Ply Account of Observation|Brandom writing about Sellars]].

Pluto was first postulated in order to explain perturbations in the orbit of Neptune (by inference from Newton's laws). At that point, Pluto was a purely theoretical object. When we got more telescopes and could observe Pluto 'directly'. Overnight, Pluto's status changed from theoretical object to observable object, but Pluto itself didn't change.
