\subtree{\title{Semantic nihilism}
  \p{[Wittgenstein](wittgenstein) is interpreted by [Dummett](michael-dummett) to be a semantic nihilist: i.e. he doesn't think there are actually meanings. The plasticity of language makes this impossible, as it is fundamentally at odds with codifying the properties of use (at best it could just give you a snapshot).

\subtree{\title{Nominalistic representationalism}
  \p{This is how Brandom characterizes de Saussure, Derrida, semiotics, textualists: they take the name-bearer relationship as the paradigm model of semantics. This is described as not taking into account the advances of Kant/Frege/Wittgenstein that show the primacy of sentences/judgments in the order of explanation, prior to names.
