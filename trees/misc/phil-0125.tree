\title{Sense data and concepts}

\p{

It feels natural to try to reduce concepts to combinations of sense impressions (this is what Locke/Hume do). This is a mistake that comes from the fact that sense impressions are \em{causally prior} to our concepts. This does not mean they are \em{conceptually prior}.

Sense data itself is not contentful/conceptual in nature and cannot stand in relations of justification/implication.
