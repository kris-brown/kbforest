\title{Myth of the Museum}

\p{


\blockquote{Uncritical semantics is the myth of a museum in which the exhibits are 
meanings and the words are labels. To switch languages is to change the 
labels.}

Against the museum myth, [Quine](wo-quine) argues here for the indeterminacy 
of "meaning" and translation.

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Sellars' 
[Myth of the Given](phil-0079) against sense-givenness.
