\title{Lost Keys}
\tag{joke}
\p{

One night, a drunk man is searching on the ground under a streetlight. An 
  officer approaches and asks "What are you looking for?"}

\p{"My keys."
}
\p{They look together for a while until the officer asks, "Are you sure you 
  dropped your keys here?"
}
\p{The man replies, "No, over there" and points to a dark patch far from the 
  streetlight.
}
\p{"Why in God's name are you looking here, then?"
}
\p{"Because there's no light over there."
}
