\title{Myth of the Given}

\p{

[[Wilfrid Sellars|Author]]

A (semantic) holist argument against meaning-givenness, like Quines' [[Myth of the Museum]] against sense-givenness.

It is common to think that knowledge begins with experience - that there are particular experiences (raw sense data) that are privileged as certain, leading to a desire to cache out all semantic interpretations of other thoughts in terms of these certain experiences (otherwise they are nonsense).
