\title{Mind-body dualism}

\p{

A [[dualisms|dualism]].

[[Ren√© Descartes|Descartes]] had invented [[representation]] but came to think of things things in the world to be divided into representeds (things) and representings (ideas).

# Complaint about Cartesian dualism

- If you're committed to "mind stuff" being non-extended,
- and to the physical world being extended,
- (throw in some general claims about causation, e.g. it occurs in a place),
- then perception and agency become unintelligble. 
  - How is the mind affected by real stuff / how can the mind cause something?

# Cartesian minds as socially constructed
This is the thesis of *[[Incorrigibility as the Mark of the Mental]]*. Cartesian minds
are something that we created because we started to treat each other a certain 
way.

The mind-body problem was a modern invention - the ancients did not struggle 
with it because they did not make Descartes' move of assimmilating "impressions"
and "thoughts" both as "ideas".
