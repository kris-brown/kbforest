\title{Successor concept}

\p{
A relationship between concepts across vocabularies. The successor concept does the work the old concept did, yet it is improved in some way.

Examples:
- Languages and theories #{\rightarrow} the 'vocabulary' vocabulary.
- Resemblance model #{\rightarrow} representation
